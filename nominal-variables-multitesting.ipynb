    "### Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This project takes the perspective of a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. The National Park Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity within their parks. The main objectives as an analyst will be understanding characteristics about the species and their conservations status, and those species and their relationship to the national parks. Some questions that are posed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has two datasets that came with the package: The first `csv` file has information about each species and another has observations of species with park locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Distributions\n",
    "1. Counts\n",
    "1. Relationship between species\n",
    "1. Conservation status of species\n",
    "1. Observations of species in parks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals will be revisited to see if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the goals section). This section will also reflect on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could also include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different methodologies.\n"

    "**When doing multiple comparisons [(from Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem)...**\n",
    "- For large-scale testing problems where the goal is to provide definitive results, the family-wise error rate (FWER) remains the most accepted parameter for ascribing significance levels to statistical tests.\n",
    "- Alternatively, if a study is viewed as exploratory, or if significant results can be easily re-tested in an independent study, control of the false discovery rate (FDR) is often preferred.\n",
    "    - Additionally, if the cost of additional experiments is low and the cost of a false negative (missing a potentially important discovery) is high, a fairly high false discovery rate should be used, like 0.10 or 0.20, so that anything important is not missed.\n",
    "    - Sometimes people use a false discovery rate of 0.05, probably because of confusion about the difference between false discovery rate and probability of a false positive when the null is true; a false discovery rate of 0.05 is probably too low for many experiments. [(McDonald, J.H. 2014)](https://www.biostathandbook.com/multiplecomparisons.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "FDR corrections allow for more Type I errors (i.e. False Positives), that is more pairwise comparisons yielding statistically significant results that could be False Positives, compared to FWER corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the differences in correction tables above, FDR correction adjusted p-values that yielded significant differences for `(Mammal, Reptile)` and `(Reptile, Nonvascular Plant)` comparisons, where FWER correction did not. These two pairs could be False Positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this dataset can be considered exploratory, there is no need to be overly conservative with discovering differences. Hence, for this project FDR corrected values will be accepted, resulting in 11 out of 21 pairwise comparisons yielding significantly different results."

    "\n",
    "The project was able to make several data visualizations and inferences about the various species in four of the National Parks that comprised this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was also able to answer some of the questions first posed in the beginning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "    - The vast majority of species were not part of conservation.(5,633 vs 191)\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "    - Mammals and Birds had the highest percentage of being in protection.\n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "    - When comparing between all species, 11 pairwise comparisons out of 21 possible pairs were significantly different, after False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction.\n",
    "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "    - The study found that bats occurred the most number of times and they were most likely to be found in Yellowstone National Park.\n"

    "\n",
    "This dataset only included observations from the last 7 days which prohibits analyze changes over time. It would be curious to see how the conservation status for various species changes over time. Another piece that is missing is the Area of each park, it can be assumed that Yellowstone National Park might be much larger than the other parks which would mean that it would exhibit more observations and greater biodiversity. Lastly, if precise locations were recorded, the spatial distribution of the species could also be observed and test if these observations are spatially clustered. "
